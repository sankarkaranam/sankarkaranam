Inheritance allows a class to reuse the code from another class.

This is like "inheriting" something from your parents. Imagine you got your mom’s hair color and your dad’s height.
In programming, inheritance means a new class can use the properties and methods of an existing class.

Example:
There’s a class called Animal.
A class Dog can inherit from Animal, so it will already have properties like "can walk" or "can eat."
The Dog class can also have its own unique features like "bark."
